# hero-in-heroin
We put the "hero" in heroin. 

## Motivation

This project was conceived when we pondered upon the grave impact that opiate addiction induces not only on addicts, but families, neighbourhoods and cities. Similar to how opiate addiction affects both the addict and the public, the solution to this plague must also be double-pronged. And thus The Hero Project was conceived.

## What is the Hero Project?

The Hero Project is a website with a portal for addicts and non-addicts. For addicts, we have a chatbot designed for addicts to receive both reactive (emergency) and proactive (addiction therapy) help. Additionally, addicts can see nearby addiction clinics, hospitals and shelters on a map. 

While the wave of opiate addiction across North America is pervasive, there is a overwhelming majority of the population that is not addicted but holds great potential. To tap this potential, we created a portal where members of the public can:
1. Find centres which offer naloxone training
2. Report needles, to create a heatmap of needle reports
3. Find local charities pertaining to the opioid crisis

## That's great, but what's the technology behind this?

The chatbot was created with Dialogflow (previously Api.ai). The dynamic maps were created using the Google Maps API, and these features were loaded onto a webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
